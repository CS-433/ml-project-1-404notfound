EPFL ML Project1

Download dataset [here](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/epfl-machine-learning-higgs/dataset_files). Extract all files and move into a new folder named `data`.

- [Project description](https://github.com/epfml/ML_course/blob/master/projects/project1/project1_description.pdf)

TODO list:

1. Competition Arena: [link](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/epfl-machine-learning-higgs).
2. Implement 6 functions in `implementations.py`. [Test](https://github.com/epfml/ML_course/tree/master/projects/project1/grading_tests) the implementations first. (Passed first four functions)
3. Submit predictions (optional). Provide a script `run.py` which produces exactly the same `.csv` predictions which you used in your best submission to the competition system.
4. Submit one report ([template](https://github.com/epfml/ML_course/tree/master/projects/project1/latex-example-paper)) and one code repository for each group. (Not sure)
